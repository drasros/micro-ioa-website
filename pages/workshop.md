While the base ideas for micro-scale environmental accounting are taking shape, significant theoretical and practical challenges remain. Turning this vision into a working global system will require a concerted, collaborative effort.

To help drive this effort forward, **Francis Charpentier** and I are initiating a workshop series on MicroIOA, **with the support of CITEPA - Jerôme Boutang**. The goal is to bring together researchers, practitioners, and policy experts to:

  - 🔍 **Diagnose** the key theoretical and practical blockage points.
  - 🧭 **Prioritize** the most critical research questions needing solutions.
  - 🛠️ **Formulate** concrete steps and collaborative projects to address them.

Our ambition is to make this a recurring forum to coordinate progress and build a cohesive community around this essential work.

**(More information, including dates and format, will be announced here soon.)**
