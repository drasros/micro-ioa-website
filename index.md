## We can't manage what we can't measure

Our economies are depleting finite environmental assets (EAs) – from clean air to rare metals – at an unsustainable rate. To navigate the coming challenges, we must transition from mindless consumption to mindful governance. But effective governance is impossible without **precise, individual-level accounting**.

Today's environmental footprinting relies on broad sector averages, obscuring responsibility and hindering effective policy. We need to move **Beyond Sector Averages**.

## What is μ-IOA?

**Micro-Scale Input-Output Analysis (μ-IOA)** is a methodological framework to calculate the environmental footprint of _every product_ and _every income_, by tracing environmental impacts through the entire web of economic transactions.

It's the foundation for:

- <i class="fa-solid fa-scale-balanced" style="color:#6BA368;"></i> Truly progressive environmental taxes.  
- <i class="fa-solid fa-leaf" style="color:#6BA368;"></i> Verifiable "green" investing and spending.  
- <i class="fa-solid fa-user-check" style="color:#6BA368;"></i> Empowering consumers and citizens with accurate data.  
- <i class="fa-solid fa-building-columns" style="color:#6BA368;"></i> Holding corporations accountable for their entire supply chain.

## A Collective, Emerging Field

This vision for granular environmental accounting is shared by a growing community. The role I'm trying to play is to help _rigorously formalize the core ideas_ and _bring people together._

While the theoretical foundations are taking shape, the vast work of building the data standards and tools for real-world adoption lies ahead. This site is a small hub for this collective effort.

## My contribution

When I first engaged with this field, I noticed some key theoretical gaps in answering a basic question: _how can we actually build a μ-IOA system?_ My work so far has focused on clarifying these, particularly the formulation of **bidirectional responsibility** and a practical **core data model** for micro-scale analysis. More details are on the [Early Note](/note) and [Publications](/publications) pages.
