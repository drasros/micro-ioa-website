**The realization of MicroIOA depends on access to micro-scale data — specifically, data on the _internal processes_ and _sales_ of economic entities.**

While this project focuses on **environmental accounting**, the same micro-level data is crucial for solving other [major global challenges](https://www.t20brasil.org/media/documentos/arquivos/TF04_ST_02_A_Call_for_Granular6700233c8418a.pdf):

- **🌍 Climate Resilience**  
    Model how shocks like floods or droughts propagate through supply networks, exposing systemic vulnerabilities and protecting infrastructure.
    
- **💸 Economic Stability**  
    Identify firms that are "too relevant to fail," monitor inflationary pressure points, and design targeted stimulus — similar to financial system stress tests.
    
- **📦 Supply Chain Security**  
    Map critical dependencies to prevent shortages (e.g., food, medicine) and enable early-warning systems for global disruptions.
    
- **🕵️‍♂️ Combatting Fraud & Enforcing Rights**  
    Uncover complex tax evasion schemes (e.g., carousel fraud) and uphold labor and human rights standards via end-to-end supply chain transparency.
    
Establishing a **global system** to standardize, verify, and securely share this data is a significant challenge — but an achievable one. Success depends on building a **critical mass of support** across disciplines.
