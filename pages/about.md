I'm Arnaud Sors, a researcher with a background in AI and data systems. My work has increasingly focused on the intersection of technology and sustainability, particularly on how we can apply modern computational methods to environmental challenges.

I became fascinated by environmental accounting after realizing how much potential there is to improve current measurement practices. This led me to explore micro-scale input-output analysis, where I've been working to identify key missing components and build connections with others in this emerging field. 

So far, I pursue this research initiative independently, alongside my work as an AI consultant.
