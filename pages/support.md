Building a practical system for micro-scale environmental accounting requires a coalition of skills and resources. 

We are particularly interested in connecting with:

👩‍🏫 **Applied Mathematicians** – Large-scale linear systems, numerical solvers, preconditioning

💻 **Developers** – Open-source tooling for environmental data modeling

🗣️ **Communicators** – Translating technical content for wider audiences

🤝 **Strategic Partners** – Bridging theory and real-world adoption

While core theoretical work continues, we're already looking ahead to our next ambition: transforming these ideas into practical, scalable tools for environmental accountability.
